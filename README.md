## Overview
This project is focused on establishing a cloud-based database and performing data queries through Azure Databricks. It involves the creation of a data pipeline and developing queries that encompass operations such as data joins and aggregations.

Dataset used: [Hata-crimes](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/hate-crimes/hate_crimes.csv)

The dataset is organized into two separate sets by dividing a specific column. This partitioning is done with the intention of merging these datasets together at a later stage for analysis and processing.
